# TODO should probably have tabs or some other mechanism to switch between files
# TODO allow saving or not saving, closing editor using escape or with X button
# TODO update changelog, readme, and package.json
# TODO write unit tests, set up travis build?
# TODO some caching?
# TODO support HTML selectors and CSS
# TODO support white space languages like python, coffeescript -> editor.getTabLength() and editor.getSoftTabs() could help
# TODO handle case where there are multiple matches in the same file
